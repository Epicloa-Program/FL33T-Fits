# Thrasher Fleet Issue

Small gang/Solo TFI


## Description

 A TFI designed for small gang and (occasionally) some solo play. Very effective against laser boat but be aware
 that the TFI is not the best brawler. If you try to ram a Catalyst Navy you will probably die, use your ability to
 scram kite and brawl against different targets. Depleted uranium + web should avoid any frigate getting under your gun.
