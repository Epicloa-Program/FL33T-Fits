# Thrasher Fleet Issue

Wolfpack/Small gang TFI


## Description

An autocannon fit for the Thrasher Fleet Issue. Now, the TFI is not a great hull for brawling
and will get eaten alive by any proper brawling destroyer, even T1. This fit is therefore made
for small gang looking to pack a punch and leave quickly. Don't try to solo with it or suffer a
quick death.
