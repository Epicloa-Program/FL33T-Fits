# Dragoon

Intermediate level armor destroyer


## Description
Small gang armor destroyer, best when flown with other armor destroyers.
Combination of neuts and drone damage with a good buffer makes it very strong
against other cap dependent destroyers and a strong force multiplier in a small
gang.
