# Bifrost
Advanced shield support destroyer

## Description
The Bifrost is designed to split up the enemy fleet. It is an excellent force multiplier. The combat probes allow you sit at a perch (e.g 250km away) and be a constant threat to the enemy. If you boosh (micro jump) their logistics away, the enemy will bleed ships.
