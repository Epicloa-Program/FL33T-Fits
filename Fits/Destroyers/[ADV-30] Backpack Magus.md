# Magus

Advanced Armor support destroyer for ENI doctrine

## Description

A pure backpack Command Destroyer with links (refit for skirm/armor links), boosh
and remote sebo to protect the logistic wings from jams. You can't FC from it cause
the lock range is too short so this is really reserved for an alt. Approach your main,
put your sebos, cycle your links and forget about it.
