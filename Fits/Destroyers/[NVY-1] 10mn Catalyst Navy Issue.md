# Catalyst Navy Issue

Solo Catalyst Navy Issue

## Description

Excellent ship for fighting all destroyers in the warzone. The 10mn CNI is a slippery ship, very hard to catch
and very rewarding to fly, having essentially a positive matchup against all other destroyers and able to run
from the fight that wouldn't turn in its favor. Understand that this is an overproped ship and don't wait
the last minute to turn on your prey as you are easy to slingshot.
