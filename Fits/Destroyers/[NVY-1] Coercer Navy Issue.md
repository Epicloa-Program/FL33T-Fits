# Coercer Navy Issue

Solo fit armor destroyer


## Description

A pure brawling fit for the Coercer Navy Issue, with double neuts and only 5 guns.
It leverages the hull bonus to neuts to suck dry any destroyers or frigate in a couple of cycle
and then grind them down while they wait their unavoidable death. In pure brawling this fit
will kill any other destroyer, however beware of kiters. The Ab/plate makes you slow you
will have no chance of catching them.
