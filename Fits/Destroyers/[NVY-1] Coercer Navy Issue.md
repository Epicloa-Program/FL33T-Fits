# Coercer Navy Issue

Solo fit/small gang fit armor destroyer


## Description

A pure brawling fit for the Coercer Navy Issue, with double neuts and only 5 guns.
It leverages the hull bonus to neuts to suck dry any destroyers or frigate in a couple of cycle
and then grind them down while they wait their unavoidable death. In pure brawling this fit
will kill any other cap reliant destroyer, however beware of kiters and capless guns and don't neut yourself out.
