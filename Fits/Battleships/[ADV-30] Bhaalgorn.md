# Bhaalgorn

Apex Comp Bhaalgorn


## Description

The strongest neuting ship in the game, the Bhaalgorn can both severely disrupt cap chains and has the neuting power to threaten even hostile capitals like Fax and Dreads. Our current fit has 4 nos and 3 neuts, with a healthy amount of cap in the mids and a focus on anti-ECM (sensor booster/sigamp) to let the bhaal do its job. A web is in cargo in case we'd need help to get the Vindicator get in position.
