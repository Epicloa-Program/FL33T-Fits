# Vindicator

Heavy web support for HA fleets

## Description

The Vindicator provides the strongest webs in the game. It requires perfect
armor support skills as it often leads the charge and will be primaried by
an enemy fleet. Heated webs with links reach far enough to grab anything
and turn it to paste. A Vindicator pilot needs to be able to communicate
effectively with the FCs and broadcast targets that it caught.
