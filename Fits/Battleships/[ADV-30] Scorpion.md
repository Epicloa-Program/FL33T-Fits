# Scorpion

ECM support for heavy armor fleets

## Description

A staple of Heavy Armor Fleets, the Scorpion provides long range boosted ECM to help
disorganizing the enemy fleet. Smartbombs helps shielding himself against offensive
missile (firewalling) and clearing off drones. The Scorpions wing will typically
be flown in a separate wing, a 100km away from the fight using premade pings.
Use the mindflood booster, it has no negative drawbacks for this fit.
