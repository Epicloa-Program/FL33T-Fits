BLOPS Sig smallgang support

## Description

A low commit skirmish composition built to snipe at very long range and instantly cloak/warpout at the first sign of danger.
Requires very good support skills to reach the proper ranges. Properly flown Slippery Petes Tengus are near unkillable
and are extremely annoying to deal with.
