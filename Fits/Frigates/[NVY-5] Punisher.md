# Punisher

Small gang/Fleet Punisher


## Description

The classic Punisher, throw it at anything and hold it until your friends show up to finish it.
To help with that you get 19.1k EHP and that's about it. Don't expect to hold other frigates with
webs or AB but it's pretty effective against cruiser and above. It's a cheap fit, don't be afraid
to throw yourself in.
