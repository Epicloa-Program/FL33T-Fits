# Slasher

Small gang/Medium fleet cheap tackle fit 


## Description

One of the best NVY capable tackle, this slasher fit is there to support your
gang or a small destroyer fleet by being the tackle. Hyperspatial rig to help
catching warp away, double nano for maximizing your mobility and align time.
Just be aware that you're not an interceptor and that once your shields are gone
you're really thin. Any RLML ship is a no go.
