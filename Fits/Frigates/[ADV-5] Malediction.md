# Malediction

Small gang/Medium fleet Malediction fit 


## Description

A regular non-blinged Malediction, harder to fly than the Stiletto (due to the active tank) but still good to learn how to fly interceptors. A good tackle for nanogangs and very useful for nullsec fleets to provide warp-in, scout, hold juicy targets etc.
