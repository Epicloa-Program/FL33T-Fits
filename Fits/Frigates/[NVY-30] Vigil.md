# Vigil

Newbro Vigil fit


## Description

A classic option for any newbro looking to get their feet wet in flying EWAR, the Vigil provides application bonus to its fleet with his target painters. Due to the diminishing returns of stacking target painters, typically only 2 or 3 Vigil are necessary per fleet. Those fits will typically be given for free before a fleet so don't be too afraid to die, and don't broadcast for reps unless the fight is really calm.
