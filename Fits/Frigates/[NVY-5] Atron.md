# Atron

Tackle Atron fit


## Description

A tackle fit for the Atron, designed for catching typical kiters and bigger hulls for its gang. The Atron is the fastest hull amongst T1 frigates and as such can fairly easily catch other MWD frigates and kiters and scram them upclose. Then the ab and the nos allows to keep the tackle and survive until the cavalry arrives. Always activate the Nos on the same tick as the scram to avoid losing tackle to neut pressure.
