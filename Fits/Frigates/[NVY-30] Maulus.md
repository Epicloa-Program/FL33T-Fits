# Maulus

Newbro Maulus fit


## Description

A classic option for any newbro looking to get their feet wet in flying EWAR, the Maulus speciality is damping, a very effective EWAR when kiting. Maulus are typically less useful when brawling but they can still impair logistics who would be too far away from the fight. Those fits will typically be given for free before a fleet so don't be too afraid to die, and don't broadcast for reps unless the fight is really calm.
