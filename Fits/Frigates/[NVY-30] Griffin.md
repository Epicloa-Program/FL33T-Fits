# Griffin

Newbro Griffin fit


## Description

A classic option for any newbro looking to get their feet wet in flying EWAR, the Griffin is everyone's nightmare, as its long distance jams can be devastating. Expect to be primaried but as those fits will typically be given for free before a fleet don't be too afraid to die, and don't broadcast for reps unless the fight is really calm. Spread your jams following their colors and keep moving.
