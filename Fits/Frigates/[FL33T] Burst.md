# Burst

Newbro Burst fit

## Description

Learn how to logi with the FL33T Burst. This frigate is a perfect starter for learning how to logi, you don't need to manage anything else than your MWD, your reps and your capacitor. This fit is not capstable (and with starting skill will quickly run out of cap) if you run everything at the same time: pulse your MWD and your reps. Purposefully kept very cheap so it's affordable to fly and lose.
