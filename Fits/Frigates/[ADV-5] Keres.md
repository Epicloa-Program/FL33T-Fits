# Keres

Small gang Keres fit


## Description

A direct upgrade from the Maulus, the Keres provide strong damps and long range point to act as secondary
tackle. Focus on dampening hostiles damps > anti-tackle ship (which will target you) > hostile DPS.
Guns are there to help clearing some light drones.
