Newbro Crucifier fit


## Description

A classic option for any newbro looking to get their feet wet in flying EWAR, the crucifier work best against turret-based composition where its tracking disruption can effectively neutralize two targets. Those fits will typically be given for free before a fleet so don't be too afraid to die, and don't broadcast for reps unless the fight is really calm.
