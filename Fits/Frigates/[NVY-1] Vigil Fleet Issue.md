# Vigil Fleet Issue

Solo fit for the Vigil Fleet Issue


## Description

A dual rep VFI fit akin to our NVY-1 Hookbill, designed to scram kite. The vigil hull bonus let it apply
rage with a single web making it a very strong scram-kiting frigate with a lot of dps and tank.
The single web however makes you vulnerable against other frigates with more control or brawlers already
setup in the plex. You will need to learn how to pick your fight and not engage recklessly.
