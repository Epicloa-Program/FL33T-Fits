# Arbitrator

PvE fit to run Rendez-Vous site in FW

## Description

A PvE Arbitrator made to run Rendez-Vous Sites and push the advantage in Faction Warfare systems. The enormous drone control range and lock range let you safely kite away the NPCs and stay far from the landing point of the site. Use the Hammerheads for max DPS on the NPCs, the warriors/ec drones are in case you get tackled and need to gtfo.
