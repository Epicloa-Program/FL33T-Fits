# Osprey Navy Issue

Small gang Osprey Navy Issue fit


## Description

The Osprey Navy Issue is the king of rapid light missile kiting. This ship gets everything, range, damage
tank, utility. Its only possible downside is its bonus towards kinetic ammo, but outside of that you cannot
go wrong by picking the ONI. Use your web defensively against fast tackle (with double neuts in case you
would get scrammed) or offensively when going in to secure a kill. Abuse your speed and your range, heat
your reps, and everything will go fine.
