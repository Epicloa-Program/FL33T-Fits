# Scythe Fleet Issue

Small gang Scythe Fleet Issue fit


## Description

A small gang fit for the Scythe Fleet Issue, that can also work solo (but don't try to brawl against webs).
Its very good speed and tiny sig radius allows this ship to catch kiters and secure a scram and then survive
using its afterburner and XLASB charges. You should ALWAYS have a standard blue pill (and optionally a hardshell),
and overheat your reps and your hardener as it increases your survivability massively. Depleted Uranium and small
neuts are to help you take care of pesky frigates.
