# Omen Navy Issue

Small gang/Solo Omen Navy Issue fit


## Description

The Omen Navy Issue is one of the best ship for pilot looking to get into kiting and wanting to graduate from the
Imperial Navy Slicers. This fit is designed to kite around 30-40km using Scorch and is best flown AWAY from your
threats, as while its range is lower than usual nanogang fits, the Nomen still excels at fragging ships in mid range.
Multifrequency and Conflags are in cargo for when you want to close in and finish a kill,
Xray for the extra tracking around the 20-25km range.
