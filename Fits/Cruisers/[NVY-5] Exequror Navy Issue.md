# Exequror Navy Issue

Small gang/Solo Exeq navy fit

## Description

After its recent revamp the Exequror Navy became one of the most scary nano ship there is.
Projection, damage, tank, speed: this ship has it all. Its only weaknesses are a cap a bit
frail when you start to rep and the bad tracking of railgun. You will need to manually pilot
to track properly while kiting and be mindful of your cap usage when repping to not cap yourself out.
