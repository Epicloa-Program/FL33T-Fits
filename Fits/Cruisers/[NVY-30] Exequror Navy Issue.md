# Exequror Navy Issue 
Projection Fleet ENI

## Description

An Exeq Navy Fit designed for long range engagement where the high projection of rails (+100km) allows
to snipe at range without taking risk. This is basically a glorified longbow. Pilot should make sure
to not constantly burn their cap boosters in order to avoid running out when it's time for kiting.
