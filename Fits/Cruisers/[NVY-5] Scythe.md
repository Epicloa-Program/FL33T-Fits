# Scythe

Cheap cap-chain free logistic for uncontested BFs and small gangs

## Description

A cheap addition to any small gang also useful for uncontested Battlefields to help running points.
The fit is fully cap stable using all its rep but cannot repair itself. For actual fighting it's better
to have at least a pair and to properly manage your positionning.
