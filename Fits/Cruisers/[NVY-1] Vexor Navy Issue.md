# Vexor Navy Issue

Solo fit for the Vexor Navy Issue


## Description

A classic double rep fit for the VNI with Heavy Neutron and a MWD. Pretty much unbeatable in 1v1 for most
cruiser, the VNI is insanely strong and will win brawls and outlast kiters. Be aware that this ship however
definitly attract the blob and while your tank is strong (use Standard Exile) it will not protect you from
it. Other than blobs you're pretty much unbeatable unless you run out of cap.
