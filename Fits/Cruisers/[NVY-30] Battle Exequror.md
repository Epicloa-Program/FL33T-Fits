# Exequror

Murderous logi doctrine

## Description

A spider tanking medium-sized gang Exequror, repping the homies while killing its targets with drones.
Hilarious to FC and fly, best enjoyed with a fresh beer and a lot of friends. Small drones and med
size drones are in cargo, refit for the one you want before undocking.
