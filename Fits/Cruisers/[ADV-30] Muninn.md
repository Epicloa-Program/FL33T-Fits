# Muninn

Armor HAC mainline ship

## Description

The mainline and bulk of our Armor HACs fleet, the Muninn has very good application and incredible tank
against Legions (the favoured T3C comp nowadays) but is a bit more lacking in overall tank compared to the Sacrilege.
Refits are in cargo to field all types of EWAR that makes the joy of flying armor.
