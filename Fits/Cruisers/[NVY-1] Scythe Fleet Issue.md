# Scythe Fleet Issue

Solo/Small gang Scythe Fleet Issue fit


## Description

A solo fit for the Scythe Fleet Issue that also works well as an anti-tackler,
tackle in a small gang. The unmatched speed, very high tank and the anti-tackle
power of the RLML makes it an incredibly resilient kiter, able to stay
on grid for a very long time. It eats a lot of cap boosters  (be ready to
regularly resupply) and the buffer is thin against high alpha.
