# Stabber Fleet Issue

Solo Stabber Fleet Issue fit


## Description

A solo active tanked fit for the Stabber Fleet Issue, designed for plex fight against other cruiser
or small gangs of destroyers/frigates. You should ALWAYS use a standard exile booster (and potentially
a hardshell or even Asklepian implants) and overheat your reppers. This fat boat is not fast: don't punch
in carelessly or suffer being kited to death.
