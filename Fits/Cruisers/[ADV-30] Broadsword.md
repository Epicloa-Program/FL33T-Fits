# Broadsword
Advanced shield support cruiser

## Description
Excellent ship for supporting shield composisions. The primary purpose of the Broadsword is to shut down enemy command destroyers, and lock down primary targets. This allows us to fit maximum tank on our DPS ships. 

Important: Warp disruption scripts will shut down a microjumpdrive, and these are very long range.
