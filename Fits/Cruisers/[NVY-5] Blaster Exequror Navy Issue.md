# Exequror Navy Issue

Small gang/Solo Exeq navy fit

## Description

As an alternative to the rail Exequror we have the blaster version: absolutely unmatched amongst cruiser
up-close but more vulnerable to getting outbrawled by specialized fits. We have opted for a Microwarpdrive,
Web and Cap Booster fit, more flexible for chasing targets in small gangs and less at risk to get
neuted out. However, beware of pure brawling cruisers with an Afterburner who could scram-kite you out of Antimatter
range or pure kiters who can outrun you.
