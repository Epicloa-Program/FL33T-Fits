# Devoter
Advanced armor support cruiser

## Description
Excellent ship for supporting armor composisions. The primary purpose of the Devoter is to shut down
enemy command destroyers, and lock down primary targets. This allows us to fit maximum tank on our DPS ships.

Important: Warp disruption scripts will shut down a microjumpdrive, and these are very long range.
