# Drake Navy Issue

FC ship for Battlefield and plex fights

## Description

A FC ship able to provide triple links and more tanky than the other T1 Battlecruisers, this Drake navy is there to support our usual Battlecruisers doctrine (Flyclones or T1) when the restriction of Faction Warfare prevents the use of T3C or Command Ships or when the FC prefers going cheap.
