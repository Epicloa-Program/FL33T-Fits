# Cyclone Fleet Issue
Intermediate level shield battlecruiser

## Description
The bread and butter of the militia. The Cyclone Fleet Issue has a wide engagement range, from battlecruisers to T3Cs. The majority of our medium scale fleets are with the Cyclone Fleet Issue. 

The default fit is HAM with maximum tank, having multiple fleet members refit to scrambler and webifier. HML is an alternate option for larger engagements where projection is king, allowing us to engage a wider range of compositions without feeding the entire fleet.

Best paired with the Osprey or Scimitar, with multiple recons and support cruisers.
