# Claymore

Link/DPS to be flown with Flyclones

## Description

The evolution of the Cyclone Fleet Issue, a bit less damage but (much) more tanky, carry links
and just as fast. Refits are provided for Shield/Skirm and Info links (unbonused by the hull).
Consider Mindlinks implants if you're flying links for the fleet and ask the FC for which
links to take before undocking. The cargohold is really tight for seeding purposes. Consider
adding more Cap boosters/Missile before undocking once you take out the unused links.
