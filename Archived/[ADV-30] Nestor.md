# Nestor

Firewalling support for HA fleets, don't be like amarr: use this if you're not flying missile yourself

## Description

The Nestor is the prime firewalling Battleship, using its smartbomb to destroy missiles
in flight before they can explode on their targets. It also allow for mid-fight refits
allowing a comp to swap between EWAR and alternate between Sniping and Brawling.

Use the mindflood booster, it has no negative drawbacks for this fit.
